  <h1>Digital Preservation: <br>The Vanishing Programmers (1980s)</h1><br>

  <div class="container">
    <!-- First row -->
    <div class="row">
      <img src="img1.jpeg" alt="img">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Old Computer</h2>
        <p>Early Filipino programming contributions were poorly documented due to lack of archiving, limited media coverage, and political/economic challenges in the 1980s.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        This old machines symbolize the roots of local innovation, showing how Filipinos were already engaging with computing despite limited resources.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Second row (baliktad) -->
    <div class="row reverse">
      <img src="img2.png" alt="img">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Programmers</h2>
        <p>Gaps in archives affect our tech memory by erasing the achievements of pioneers, making it harder for future generations to recognize local innovators.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Many Filipino programmers contributed silently in the background, but their names and works often went unrecognized because documentation was incomplete.
    </p>

    <!-- Third row -->
    <div class="row">
      <img src="img3.jpg" alt="img">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Digitization</h2>
        <p>Digitization ensures these fading stories and innovations are preserved for future researchers, students, and innovators in the digital age.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Through scanning, oral histories, and archiving, we can rebuild the lost narratives of Filipino programmers and give credit where it is due.
    </p>
  
  <div class="row reverse">
      <img src="img4.jpg" alt="img">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Political, Economic, and Gender Biases</h2>
        <p>Early records often favored those in big companies, government projects, or male programmers, while women or independent developers were less documented.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Political situations in the 1980s (like martial law and economic struggles) meant some contributions were ignored or lost, so not everyone’s work was preserved equally.
    </p>
    
    <div class="row">
      <img src="img6.jpg" alt="img">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Comparison with Other Nations</h2>
        <p>Unlike the Philippines, countries like the US and Japan had better archiving, media coverage, and institutional support, which preserved the work of early programmers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Comparing helps us see that stronger record-keeping and valuing contributions regardless of gender or status can prevent tech memory from being lost.
    </p>
